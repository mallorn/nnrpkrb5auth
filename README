This is a quick hack to do NNRP authentication against a Kerberos password.
This DOES NOT include Kerberos authentication via ticket passing -- it 
only compares a username/password pair against the corresponding
Kerberos V principal/password.

You'll need to copy the resulting binary into ~news/bin/auth/passwd and
add the appropriate lines to your readers.conf file.  For example:

   auth "authenticated2" {
      auth: "nnrpkrb5auth --instance=foo"
   }

   auth "authenticated" {
      auth: "nnrpkrb5auth --instance=example.com"
   }

   access "authenticated2" {
      users: "foo"
      newsgroups: "hort.*,example.foo.*"
   }

   access "authenticated" {
      users: "*/example.com"
      newsgroups: "hort.*"
   }

Hopefully this will be of some use to people out there.
